            <h2>Deafheaven – <em>Lonely People With Power</em></h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle">The power that comes from accepting loneliness, and the depression that comes with that power.</h3>
          
            <p>I don’t think it’s possible to talk about a Deafheaven album without mentioning <em>Sunbather</em>. So let me start at the beginning: to me, 
              <strong>Sunbather</strong> was one of the most striking albums of the 2010s—maybe even the most striking metal record of that decade. The band had an approach unlike anything else. 
              When <em>Sunbather</em> came out, they could’ve called their music anything they wanted: post-shoegaze, post-dreamcore, or any made-up term.</p>
          
            <p>Even though blackgaze existed before, Deafheaven’s take was, in my opinion, beyond the genre. Their use of instruments leaned heavily into texture and atmosphere, 
              with strong post-rock influences. By incorporating screamo elements, they managed to express both the aggressive side of black metal and the melancholia of shoegaze 
              more effectively. I think that connection is what drove the flow of their music and set Deafheaven apart.</p>
          
            <hr>
          
            <h3>The Weight of Following Up a Masterpiece</h3>
            <p>After <em>Sunbather</em>, Deafheaven faced the pressure of following a masterpiece, and they steered into darker waters by incorporating Bay Area thrash influences. 
              The fact that they managed to get heavier while still delivering emotional melodies and a more cohesive overall flow was truly impressive.</p>
          
            <p>To me, <strong>New Bermuda</strong>, the follow-up to <em>Sunbather</em>, proved that Deafheaven is a special band—one that simply doesn't make bad records. Even <strong>Infinite Granite</strong>, 
              where they toned down the black metal and screamo sides, still felt like a solid album.</p>

            <h3>A New Era, A Clearer Voice</h3>
            <p>Now, let’s talk about <strong>Lonely People With Power</strong>. Judging by the album cover alone, it’s clear that Deafheaven chose to follow their own path instead of retracing 
              <em>Infinite Granite</em>.</p>
          
            <p>The album kicks off with the spine-shattering riffs of <strong>“Doberman”</strong>, followed by the pedal-to-the-metal momentum of <strong>“Magnolia.”</strong> It’s like the band is shouting, 
              “Screw <em>Infinite Granite</em>, we’re done with that.” And then, just like that, they calm down and dive into cooling waters with layered, reverb-heavy guitars.</p>

            </div>  

            <p>I believe the band took the feedback from <em>Infinite Granite</em> to heart. They made a real effort not to repeat it—but also took care not to make <em>Sunbather</em> 2.0. 
              While they haven’t ditched the post-rock influence, they’ve focused more on <strong>impact</strong> than pure atmosphere.</p>
          
            <p>In the softer moments, the shimmering guitar tones feel like sunlight refracted through crystal. But in tracks like <strong>“Heathen”</strong> and <strong>“Body Behavior,”</strong> they hit like a dagger through your soul.</p>

            <h3>Cinematic Despair</h3>
            <p>Even the transitions cut deep. Another strength of this album is its cinematic quality. It carries the passion of <em>The Florida Project</em> (2017) and the heartache of 
              <em>Aftersun</em> (2022), pulling me into a whirlpool of rumination every time I listen. It heightens my anxieties about the future.</p>
          
            <p>What elevates this album to <strong>masterpiece status</strong> in my eyes is the sheer solidity of the riffs and melodies. Some passages felt like I’d been listening to them 
              forever. From the very first spin, I found it iconic. Tracks like <strong>“Doberman,” “Heathen,”</strong> and <strong>“Body Behavior”</strong> feel like relics from the ’90s. 
              I don’t mean to say Deafheaven is totally original—but I do think they’ve matured into a sound they fully own and know exactly how to cook to perfection.</p>
          
            <p>Deafheaven has already been the soundtrack of many lives, just by the nature of their music. But with this album, I believe they’ll reach even more people—and 
              gain deeper respect from their existing fans.</p>
          
            <p><strong><em>Lonely People With Power</em></strong> shines like a sheet of aluminum foil in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. If it’s evoking these feelings in April, 
              I can’t imagine what it’ll do in summer. We’re still in the first quarter of the year, but Deafheaven might have already won.</p>
