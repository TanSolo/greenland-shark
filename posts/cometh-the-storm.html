  <h2>High on Fire – <em>Cometh the Storm</em></h2>
  <p><em>A forceful return where riffs and rage reign supreme—Matt Pike does it again.</em></p>

  <p>When someone asks me, “Who’s your favorite guitarist?”—outside of obvious names like <strong>Tony Iommi</strong> or <strong>Jimi Hendrix</strong>—one of the first 
    names that comes to mind is <strong>Matt Pike</strong>. I’ve enjoyed pretty much every album he’s made with <strong>Sleep</strong> and <strong>High on Fire</strong>, 
    and I’ve even found his side projects fairly satisfying. Beyond the impact of the riffs he writes, I’ve always respected him for his solid songwriting and his ability 
    to give space to his fellow musicians.</p>

  <p>Because of that, <em>Cometh the Storm</em> was one of my most anticipated albums of the year.</p>

  <p>At first, when I listened to <em>Burning Down</em>, it reminded me too much of the <em>Sleep</em> era and didn’t seem particularly exciting. Then, when I saw the 
    track titles, my expectations dropped even more. After delving into arcane and mystical concepts on <em>De Vermis Mysteriis</em>, and drawing inspiration from 
    Robert W. Chambers’ <em>The King in Yellow</em> on <em>Luminiferous</em> and <em>Electric Messiah</em>, seeing titles like <em>Lambsbread</em>, <em>The Beating</em>, 
    and <em>Tough Guy</em> made me go, “What the hell is this?” I loved it when <strong>High on Fire</strong> leaned into mystical themes, so seeing them pivot to weed and 
    machismo felt like a letdown.</p>

  <p>And as if that wasn’t enough, co-founder <strong>Des Kensel</strong> had left the band. Even though <strong>Coady Willis</strong> seemed like a solid choice, 
    I didn’t think he could be as good. I was slowly convincing myself I was about to listen to the weakest <strong>High on Fire</strong> album.</p>

  <p>Lucky for me, I was wrong.</p>

  <p><em>Cometh the Storm</em> is a fantastic album. The choice to explore more surface-level themes seems to stem from the need to release six years’ worth 
    of pressure after <em>Electric Messiah</em>’s epic highs. As you can tell from the title track, <strong>Coady Willis</strong> delivers a performance every bit 
    as good as <strong>Des Kensel</strong>.</p>

  <p>The album is a testosterone-pumping masculinity manifesto, flipping the listener on their head with its tempo shifts. It has everything you’d want from 
    <strong>High on Fire</strong>: crushing riffs, pounding drums, Middle Eastern melodies, brutal hardcore sections—you name it. You’ll consume it all gladly, 
    because otherwise, <em>Matt Pike will fuck you up</em>.</p>

  <p>While <strong>High on Fire</strong> doesn’t reinvent the genre on their ninth album, they absolutely push themselves creatively. Tracks like <em>Karanlık Yol</em>—clearly 
    influenced by <strong>Neşet Ertaş’s</strong> “Yolcu”—and <em>Lambsbread</em> tap into more specific geographic inspirations in a more mature way than 
    <em>Death Is This Communion</em> ever did. The track <em>Trismegistus</em> also carries similar regional flavors.</p>

  <p>Even where they don’t innovate musically, the band makes sure to deliver top-tier performances. <em>Darker Fleece</em>, which opens with a <em>Dopesmoker</em> nod, 
    is one of their best album closers. <em>The Beating</em> is probably their most fun hardcore punk track to date. That said, I’ll admit the album does contain a few 
    tracks that aren’t particularly memorable—but hey, consider that a small flaw in an otherwise stellar piece.</p>

  <p>Another standout aspect of the album is <strong>Kurt Ballou</strong>. It's no secret that he elevates every band he works with—<strong>Nails</strong>, 
    <strong>Russian Circles</strong>, <strong>Kvelertak</strong>, and of course, <strong>Converge</strong>. Once bands work with him, they rarely go back. With 
    <em>Cometh the Storm</em>, Ballou has helped <strong>High on Fire</strong>—already a high-standard band—take another step forward. The drums shake your heartbeat, 
    and the guitars sound like they’re forged in lava. From a production standpoint, it’s their most captivating album yet.</p>

  <p>In short, <em>Cometh the Storm</em> is a release where the band clearly tries to reinvent themselves while still playing at their absolute best. It may not be their 
    best album ever, but it’s far from their weakest. And the fact that <strong>Matt Pike</strong> can still deliver work of this caliber after 12 albums—including 
    <strong>Sleep</strong>—is nothing short of commendable.</p>
